			<h2>r/place 2023</h2>
			<p>We did it again, folks.</p>

			<p>Despite r/place not happening at the time we expected it to happen. Despite the massive API protests that give Reddit a sour taste in our mouths. Despite botnets being at their worst since the first canvas. Despite our numbers being notably thinner this time. Amidst all these changes that divide, <i>we make it united</i>. United against streamers who intended to destroy our logo. United with our allies to leave our mark on this ephemeral canvas.</p>
				
			<p>In 2017 and 2022, we earned our spots on the canvas. Now, in 2023, we earned it again.</p>
				
			<p>Thank you everyone, for all the pickles held and placed for our pink circle and our allies. See you next time.</p>

			<p>(Also... Fuck Spez!)</p>

			<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
			<h4>
				General issues
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you get a notification saying "<b>No default template set.</b>", you can safely ignore it! But if you'd like it to go away, you can go to the Template Manager settings and add <code>https://osu.place/e/osuplace2023.json</code> to "Always Load".
				</li>
				<li>
					If the overlay is <b>off-center</b>, set your browser zoom to exactly <b>100%</b>! You can usually do this by pressing <code>Ctrl + 0</code>, but you might need to do it in your browser menu.
					<ul>
						<li>
							If this doesn't resolve the issue, try to <b>zoom out more</b>. This happens when you have <b>screen scaling</b> on in your operating system settings. For example, if you have 125% scaling, you'd need 80% zoom in your browser. Play around with it!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>
				iOS issues
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you get an error saying "<b>Failed to write</b>" when installing the userscript, open the <b>Userscripts app in your app list</b>, then tap on <b>Set Userscripts Directory</b>, go to the <b>"On my iDevice"</b> folder, make a <b>new folder called "Userscripts"</b>, and pick the folder you just made.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're trying to install the userscript by downloading the file but iOS doesn't recognize it as a JavaScript file, <b>you don't need to do this!</b> Just open the userscript <b>in your browser</b>, open the <b>Userscripts extension</b>, and tap on the <b>green banner</b> to install the script.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you get template <b>notifications</b> but don't see <b>the actual overlay</b>, try refreshing a couple times!
				</li>

		<p>From all of us over at /r/osuplace, thank you!</p>

			<p>What an amazing time.</p>
			
			<p>I'm too much of a mess to write more of my wild heartfelt letters to you guys, but what I will say is this:</p>
			
			<p>Together, we have achieved something more.</p>
			
			<p>See you next time :)</p>

		<h2>pxls.space Canvas #2</h2>
		<p>Guys, I don't know if I could be more proud of you.</p>

		<p>On /r/Place, we showed something that was unmatched by any other community out there. We were resilient and unmoving. Our pink circle, despite however many times people tried to destroy it, would keep coming back, better than before.</p>
			
		<p>On pxls.space, we did it again. We were destroyed multiple times, but we kept coming back.</p>
			
		<p>Not only did we come back, we expanded our territory in an incredible fashion. We made art of Kanna, Pippi, a ppy logo, we achieved something I really didn't dream was possible.</p>
			
		<p>And sure, this is much ado about something as minor as a bunch of pixels, but together we created something more.</p>
			
		<p>As the pxls.space canvas resets, we can remember that we worked together for several weeks on something that we like. The simple game about clicking circles brought together literally thousands of people with the one mutual goal. And I think it's safe to say we blew that goal out of the water.</p>
			
		<p>The canvas is wiped. And personally I know that the drive to do it all over again is no longer the same. Thus, I believe we will shut down the pixel-placing project. But this time, it is not an air of defeat. This time, we did it.</p>
			
		<p>Thank you to everyone who helped us. It really couldn't have been done without the help of each and every one of your pixels. I wish I could thank you all individually... but I do not have the time to hunt down the thousands of you that all contributed.</p>

		<p>See you next time.<br>-Emanuel Furman</p>

		<h2>r/place 2017</h2>
		<p>Well, looks like the dust has settled. Honestly, it's been a fun journey. Regardless of our differences, I'm glad we had the opportunity to all work on the same canvas; to make art. Even if we weren't the most loved out there, we still wished for the success of every project.</p>

		<p>Our plans were to donate a ton of our space to pink-themed projects. We had 2hu, mew, kirby, and others lined up. We wanted to give back to the community, to prove we weren't greedy. Now, unfortunately, that dream cannot be realized. However, know that the almost 1000 osu! placers were thankful to be able to participate in this experiment with you all. Thank you for playing with us :)</p>

		<p>Regards, osu!place</p>
